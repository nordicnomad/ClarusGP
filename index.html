            <div class="slideContain">
                <h2>Process Management</h2>

                <p>Our consultants provide BPM expertise to our clients that enables their organizations to be more efficient, more effective and more capable of change that ultimately helps the organization to gain higher customer satisfaction, increase product quality and reduce the delivery time of IT services across the Enterprise This is accomplished through the following key areas:</p>

                <h3>Six Sigma & Lean Six Sigma Consulting</h3>

                <p>Originally developed to improve manufacturing efficiency and quality, Lean Six Sigma is now being widely adopted by both public and private sector in industries such as telecom, finance, medical and retailers. Lean Six Sigma is a blend of two concepts: lean manufacturing, which is aimed at reducing waste, and Six Sigma, which helps companies reduce errors. Together they can help companies reap the benefits of faster processes with lower cost and higher quality.</p>

                <p>We help clients address strategic priorities and transform operations by removing waste and driving high-quality business processes through the integration of the proven improvement methodologies of Lean (Speed) and Six Sigma (Quality).</p>

                <p>We provide Lean Six Sigma consulting to help identify more efficient business processes in the existing environment and we work with leadership on implementing DFLSS(Design For Lean Six Sigma)across the enterprise for all new projects, which will help tremendously reduce cost insure project efficiency prior to project kick-off.</p>

                <h3>The Five Phases of Six Sigma</h3>
                <p>The most commonly used approach to implementing Six Sigma is known as ‘DMAIC’:</P>
                <ul>
                    <li>Define the customers, their requirements, the process or the project boundaries</li>
                    <li>Measure the performance of the current process</li>
                    <li>Analyze information and identify where improvements can be made</li>
                    <li>Improve the process to achieve required performance</li>
                    <li>Control the implementation, monitoring results and introducing training and incentives to maintain process improvements</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>PMO Development</h3>

                <p>Why establish a PMO?</p>

                <p>According to a Gartner study, organizations who establish standards for project management, including a PMO, with suitable governance, will experience half the major project cost overruns, delays, and cancellations of those that fail to do so.</p>

                <p>In a separate study it was found that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>76% surveyed companies had created a PMO</li>
                    <li>The longer the PMO, the higher the project success rates</li>
                    <li>65.8% of high performing organizations have enterprise PMOs</li>
                    <li>PMO’s deliver a return in three to six months by providing the visibility needed to cancel, postpone, or scale back unnecessary or less strategic projects</li>
                    <li>PMOs are significantly better at meeting critical success factors, including having effective sponsorship, accountability, competent staff, quality leadership and demonstrated value.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Keys to building a successful PMO:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Define a clear scope and purpose of the PMO</li>
                    <li>Understand which type of PMO is needed, not a “One size fits all” approach</li>
                    <li>Have a good communication strategy to drive organizational acceptance of PMO</li>
                    <li>Define Data requirements and have accurate data in order to report metrics.</li>
                    <li>Achieve, document, and communicate. Achieve successes, document them and communicate these successes, regardless of how miniscule.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>How Clarus Can Help</p>

                <p>We utilize our knowledge of Business Process Management to team with leadership in developing a PMO structure that is specific to the business and IT needs of the organization.  This can involve a traditional PMO structure or a PMO based on new approaches such as Lean, Agile, Kanban, or even a combination of these methods.  We will work with the stakeholders to identify the best practices and processes to maximize the R.O.I. on the PMO.</p>

                <h3>Project Management</h3>

                <p>Project management as a profession is well researched and has been written about extensively. In fact, the Project Management Institute`s highly regarded Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) identifies 5 project stages and 9 knowledge areas.</p>

                <p>With all that is written and understood about project management, why do so many projects run too long, over budget or never meet their initial goals?</p>

                <p>Two fixed pieces of any project, regardless of methodology, are time and budget.  Every other step or stage, of a project, are constrained by time and budget. Once an organization has a firm understanding of this basic principle then all other details can be aligned. Once a clear and concise goal has been stated and has received approval upon a budget and timeframe then the other several factors that will ensure successful delivery can be considered.</p>

                <p>Clarus provides project management support to our clients that specifically meet our clients goals and Project Management methodology. When requested, we can provide best practices and recommendations for our clients specific Project Management methodology.</p>

                <h3>Business Analysis</h3>

                <p>The Business Analyst is an agent of change. Business Analysis is a disciplined approach for introducing and managing change to organizations, whether they are for-profit businesses, governments, or non-profits.</p>

                <p>Business analysts work across all levels of an organization and may be involved in everything from defining strategy, to creating the enterprise architecture, to taking a leadership role by defining the goals and requirements for programs and projects or supporting continuous improvement in its technology and processes.</p>

                <p>At Clarus Group we believe that the analysis and design phase of any project is the point where a projects success or failure can be measured.  Clear, defined and documented requirements will limit the risk and chance of failure of any project. This can be achieved by many means, one way that we feel is extremely beneficial is called DFLSS.</p>

                <h4>Design for Lean Six Sigma (DFLSS)</h4>

                <p>Lean Six Sigma tries to fix broken processes that already exist. But what if there were a way to create higher quality processes at the design stage?</p>

                <p>A variant of Six Sigma, Design For Lean Six Sigma (DFLSS) is a methodology used to design from scratch or re-design a product or process to one that meets customer requirements and has an expected quality level of Six Sigma.</p>

                <p>DFLSS is about “getting it right the first time” instead of improving later (the focus of DMAIC Six Sigma). That’s the point where the cost of change is lowest and the ease of implementation is the highest.</p>

                <p>That’s where Lean is added to the mix, so it’s all the tools and techniques put together. A growing number of deployments are describing their efforts as DFLSS.</p>

                <h2>IT Security</h2>

                <p>Clarus Group can help organizations maximize the business value of enterprise security to achieve high performance.</p>

                <p>In the cloud-enabled, highly networked world of modern computing, security is one of the most important facets of proper software engineering.</p>

                <p>The most important thing to understand about security is that it is not a bullet point item. You cannot bolt it on at the end of the development process. You must consciously design security into your app or service from the very beginning, and make it a conscious part of the entire process from design through implementation, testing, and release.</p>

                <p>We have experience helping public and private sector clients use security to both defend against threats and enable them to develop new business processes while maintaining acceptable levels of risk.</p>

                <p>We provide a broad range of information security services through the entire SDLC from strategy trough deployment in all aspects of the enterprise such as Application Security, Cloud/ Network Security and Big Data Security.</p>

                <h3>Application Security</h3>

                <p>As the number of Web sites reaches over 255 million and Internet users reach 2 billion, hackers continue to relentlessly attack at the Web application level. Exploiting various vulnerabilities, they seek the low hanging fruit. No one is spared. Financial industry, Government Agencies, Telecommunications, e-Retail companies, high-tech companies, and social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook have all been victims of repeated attacks.</p>

                <p>In spite of this, most companies are doing very little to secure their Web apps. With network infrastructure only fairly secure, hackers are going after the weakest link – Web applications. The majority of vulnerabilities continue to be in tis area. Many of these vulnerabilities have a public exploit, and even when patches are available most companies still haven’t deployed these patches.</p>

                <p>In a recent study conducted by the Ponemon Institute, Cenzic, and Barracuda Networks, 72 percent of respondents test less than 10 percent of their Web applications, even though 73 percent admitted that they have been hacked at least once in the last 24 months.</p>

                <p>When building a web application there are common practices which should be followed to enhance security. In addition to the basic security of the server operating system and runtimes, web developers should follow accepted guidelines to write secure applications. These best practices expand on the security best practices which should be applied to all applications.</p>

                <p>At Clarus Group our developers are certified in developing secured applications and are constantly staying informed of the latest vulnerabilities and the best practices for securing our clients environment. We can apply that expertise to your organization and provide your company with the additional security that is needed in this ever changing environment.</p>

                <h3>Cloud Security</h3>

                <p>Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.</p>

                <p>In an IDC survey of 244 IT executives/CIOs published last fall, 75 percent of the respondents cited security as a significant or very significant challenge with cloud computing. Compare that with 63 percent cited for the next two concerns–performance and availability.</p>

                <p>With so many companies pushing more and more services to the cloud, now more than ever, security needs to be at the forefront of the discussion. In 2011 $48 billion was lost due to breaches, 526 million records have been compromised in the past 5 years. This trend is only going up unless more emphasis is placed on not just securing your environment, but securing it correctly.</p>

                <p>Clarus Group can provide the expertise in assisting any organization, public or private, in reaching their security goals by providing consultants that are certified security experts and have knowledge and experience of industry best practices and standards. Our goal is to have our consultants one step ahead of the threat, not reacting to it.</p>

                <h3>Big Data Security</h3>

                <p>Big Data is big buzz in the information security world. The promise of what huge data stores can offer to the business drives the obsession with collection. But for the security professional, Big Data equals big risk – and potentially big headaches. The security implications for collecting, storing and utilizing data are multi-fold.</p>

                <h4>Big Data in Today’s Business and Technology Environment</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>2.7 Zetabytes of data exist in the digital universe today.</li>
                    <li>IDC Estimates that by 2020, business transactions on the internet- business-to-business and business-to-consumer – will reach 450 billion per day.</li>
                    <li>More than 5 billion people are calling, texting, tweeting and browsing on mobile phones worldwide.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With all this information Data Security is paramount.  The issue that most organization have is that their security professionals apply most controls at the very edges of the network, however, if attackers penetrate your perimeter, they will have full and unrestricted access to your data — and thanks to big data, it will all be in one place. By placing controls as close as possible to the data store and the data itself, you can create a more effective line of defense.</p>

                <p>Clarus Group Big Data consultants can provide the guidance and expertise to develop these security controls as close to the data as possible in order to provide a more secure line of defense in case the outer perimeter of your security controls are breached.  The R.O.I. of this additional layer of security could be immeasurable compared to a breach of large amounts of client/customer data.</p>
